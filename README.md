# Product Design Portfolio Template

This project started as a personal portfolio I designed and developed to showcase my work as a product designer. As I was working on it, I realized other designers might benefit from having a similar template to quickly and easily create their own portfolios. So here it is â€” now available for anyone to use and customize! ðŸŽ‰

This easy-to-use portfolio template showcases my work. Built with Vue.js, itâ€™s ideal for designers looking to present their projects in an engaging and professional way.

> Note: You donâ€™t need advanced coding experience to use this template. Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and some JavaScript is enough to get started.

## How to use

### 1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/product-design-portfolio.git
   cd product-design-portfolio
   ```

### 2. Install dependencies & start local development:

If you want to develop locally, use Vite for a fast setup:

   ```bash
   npm install # Install dependencies
   npm run dev # Start local server
   ```

### 3. **Customize your portfolio:**

- **Herader:** Edit `Header.vue` to add your favicon, name, and social media links.
- **Footer:** Edit `Footer.vue` to include your email or a call-to-action.
- **Home:** Edit `Home.vue` with your introduction, project thumbnails, and descriptions.
- **About:** Personalize `About.vue` to share more about yourself and your story.
- **Experience:** Edit `Experience.vue` to include your most recent roles and accomplishments.

To add and edit individual projects, refer to the [Project Template Component](#project-template-component) section below.

### 4. **Build the project for production:**

Once you've customized your portfolio, build the project for deployment:

   ```bash
   npm run build  # Generates the dist folder for production
   ```

### 5. **Deploy the Portfolio:**

**Option 1: Deploy to Your Own Server**
1. Upload the contents of the dist folder to your web server.
2. Ensure your server is configured to serve static files.

**Option 2: Deploy via GitHub Pages**
1. Follow the instructions for setting up [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
2. You can automate the deployment with the following command using `gh-pages` (if the project is already built):

   ```bash
   npm install gh-pages --save-dev
   npm run deploy
   ```
   
   This command builds the project and deploys it directly to your GitHub Pages.

:boom: Boom! Your portfolio is online, it was that easy!

## Project Template Component

### Usage

2. Rename the file to reflect the projectâ€™s name.
3. Update router.js to create a new route for the project.
4. Customize the sections. You can add more or remove them depending on your needs. Here are the sections provided in the template.
