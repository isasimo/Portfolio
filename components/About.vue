    <h2><span class="highlight">Hey! Hola! Hallo!</span> I’m Isa, a product designer in Switzerland</h2>
    <p>My journey into the design world began at the age of 15, using CorelDRAW (who remembers that?) I emerged victorious in a poster design contest for my hometown's festivities. From that moment, I was hooked.</p>

    <p>My formal education in graphic design introduced me to the foundations of typography, color, layout and the basics of design. This education, paved a way to the modern design scenes of Barcelona and Madrid, where I collaborated with companies and startups to create multimedia experiences. In 2012, I developed an interactive website for "Els Convidats", the first interactive miniseries produced in Catalonia. The project earned recognition with a Laus, a prestigious design award in Catalonia.</p>

    <p>In 2015, I embarked on a new adventure in Switzerland, where I landed into Product Design for the first time, that's the moment when everything just clicked. Joining Disney Research, I found myself immersed in a world of innovation and creativity, my role was to bring prototypes to life for R&D. Since then, I've been drawn to the challenge of integrating cutting-edge technology into interfaces while ensuring the best possible user experience, regardless the age.</p>

    <p>Between career milestones, I took two breaks in 2014 and 2018, embracing the freedom to travel the world without a fixed return ticket. These journeys enriched my perspective and creativity while learning new skills like a Permaculture Design Certificate. I'm a strong believer of continuous learning in all type of fields, not just design.</p>

    <p>In my free time, you'll often find me hiking in the Alps or cultivating hundreds of kilos of veggies in the community garden I founded in my hometown. Sharing my heart between two places, I feel at home in both Barcelona and Switzerland.</p>

    <p>In addition, I’m a proud <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/profiles/cc17b6f3582c9">ENFP-A Campaigner</a> who likes to connect and cooperate with people.</p>
